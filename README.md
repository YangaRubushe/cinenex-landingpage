### Inspiration and Challenges

Creating CineNex was inspired by the desire to provide an accessible and enjoyable movie streaming platform. One of the main challenges was implementing the search functionality to quickly filter through a large database of films efficiently. 

Future iterations of CineNex will focus on enhancing the recommendation system, improving the user interface, and adding more features such as user reviews and ratings.
